Forward Voltage (Vf)

At higher temperature (75 °C):

The forward voltage drop of the diode decreases. This means the diode starts conducting at a voltage when it is not at 25 degrees Celsius. The diode will start conducting at a voltage compared to when it is, at 25 degrees Celsius.

When you use a silicon diode the forward voltage of the silicon diode actually gets lower. The silicon diodes forward voltage drops by 2 millivolts, for every degree Celsius the temperature of the silicon diode goes up.

 So when you do a DC sweep: the voltage curve of the diode shifts to the left at 75 degrees Celsius. This means that for an amount of current the voltage across the diode is a little lower than it is at 25 degrees Celsius. The diode voltage curve is important here so the diode voltage forward curve shifts to the left, at the higher temperature.

Reverse Current (Leakage)

At higher temperature (75 °C):

The reverse leakage current of the diode increases a lot. This happens when the diode is reverse-biased. In this situation more current flows through the diode. The diode has an increase, in reverse leakage current.

When the temperature goes up more electron-hole pairs are created in the semiconductor. This is what happens because the semiconductor makes electron-hole pairs when it gets hotter. The semiconductor generates these electron-hole pairs because of the heat.

📌 When you do a reverse-bias sweep you will notice that the leakage current curve is higher at 75 degrees Celsius than it is, at 25 degrees Celsius.

🧠 Why Temperature Affects Diodes

Semiconductors are made up of things called atoms. These atoms have things that can carry electricity like electrons and holes. They get made when the strong links, between the atoms, called bonds are broken. When the temperature goes up:

More thermal energy → more charge carriers → current flows more easily.

When we talk about bias the barrier potential is actually lowered. This means the voltage or Vf is lower. So in bias we have a lower Vf, which is important to know when we are dealing with forward bias and the barrier potential of forward bias.

The thing about this is that it also helps to increase the leakage current when it's in reverse bias. This happens because there are minority carriers that are available to conduct the current. Minority carriers are really important in this situation. When we talk about minority carriers we are talking about the electrons and holes that're available to conduct the current. So the more minority carriers that are available the more the leakage current will increase when it is, in bias. This is what happens with minority carriers.

So basically when the semiconductor gets hot it starts to work. This means it can conduct electricity easily in both directions, which is not always what we want. The semiconductor conducts electricity forward which is what it is supposed to do and it also conducts electricity in reverse, which is not what we want to happen with the semiconductor.

What you will see when you use LTspice is that it has a lot of features. You will observe that LTspice has things that can help you with your work.

When you open LTspice you will see options. LTspice has a lot of tools that you can use to make your work easier.

You will observe that LTspice is very useful for people who work with electronics. LTspice helps people design and test circuits.

Some things you will observe in LTspice include:

* Many different types of components

* Tools to help you design and test circuits

* Options to change how your circuit looks and works

You will observe that LTspice is a very helpful tool, for people who work with electronics and LTspice can make your work easier and faster.

1) Forward Voltage

When you do a DC sweep or look at the versus voltage curve of something, like a diode or a transistor you are basically looking at how the current of the electronic component changes when you change the voltage. The I–V curve is really important because it shows you how the electronic component behaves. You can see how the current of the electronic component increases or decreases when you change the voltage. This is really useful when you are designing circuits and you want to know how the electronic components will behave.

When it is really hot at 75 degrees Celsius, the voltage or Vf that is needed to get the same amount of current is actually lower than when it is cooler, at 25 degrees Celsius. The forward voltage, Vf is a thing to consider in these situations.

• This happens because the barrier that is naturally, inside the PN junction gets weaker when it gets hotter. For example with silicon diodes it gets 2 millivolts weaker for every degree the temperature goes up. The PN junction is the reason this happens with the PN junction.

When you look at your plots you will see that the forward curve is different at 75 degrees Celsius. It is shifted to the left compared to the curve at 25 degrees Celsius. The forward curve at 75 degrees Celsius is not the same as the curve, at 25 degrees Celsius.

2) Reverse Current (Leakage)

In reverse bias:

The reverse leakage (saturation) current increases strongly at higher temperature.

• When we have thermal energy it makes more electron-hole pairs. This means that more charge carriers are made.. That is why we get more leakage from these extra charge carriers, in the thermal energy.

 When we look at the temperature of 75 degrees Celsius the reverse current is really big compared to 25 degrees Celsius. The reverse current at 75 degrees Celsius is often extremely higher than, at 25 degrees Celsius.

The temperature really affects how diodes work. Diodes are like one way streets for electricity. They let it flow one way but not the other.

When it gets hot or cold the diode behaves differently. The temperature changes how well the diode does its job. This is important to know because diodes are used in many things like phones and computers.

* The diode will turn on at a voltage when it is hot

* It will turn on at a voltage when it is cold

The diodes behavior is not the same, at different temperatures. This means that temperature affects diodes in a way. Temperature and diodes are closely related. The temperature really affects how diodes work.

Semiconductor diodes work because of semiconductor diodes using charge carriers. These charge carriers are electrons and holes that move across a junction, in the semiconductor diodes.

When the temperature goes up it helps create free carriers. The heat gives them the energy they need. This means the forward barrier is lower and the current is higher when you use the voltage. The temperature and the carriers are really important here the temperature increases the carrier generation. That is what helps to create more free carriers.

When a diode is in bias the extra carriers cause more leakage current to flow. This is a problem because the diode is supposed to block the current. The diode is not doing its job when it lets this current flow. The leakage current is still flowing through the diode even though it is, in bias. This means that the diode is not blocking the current like it is supposed to and the extra carriers are causing more leakage current to flow through the diode.

When we talk about semiconductors heat does a job. It gives energy to the semiconductor. This means that the current can flow easily. It can go both ways, forward and backward.. The higher the temperature of the semiconductor the easier it is for the current to flow in both forward and reverse directions. The semiconductor gets energy from the heat. So the current flows easily in the semiconductor as the temperature rises.

Why This Matters in Real Systems

1) Voltage Levels Change

A diodes voltage drop is not the same all the time. It actually gets smaller when it gets hotter. So if a circuit is designed to work with a voltage drop, like 0.7 V the real voltage drop of the diode may be different when it is hot. This can cause problems, with the circuit like changing the bias points and signal levels of the diode.

2) Water leakage can cause a lot of errors. This is because leakage of water can lead to problems with the system. The leakage of water can make the system not work properly. This can cause errors. So we have to make sure that there is no leakage of water, in the system to avoid these errors. Leakage of water is an issue that can cause a lot of trouble.

When the temperature gets really high the reverse leakage in something like a diode can get bigger. This can make electricity flow when it is not supposed to. That means more power is used even when things are turned off. This is a deal for things that need to be very precise or use very little power. The increased reverse leakage at temperature can cause problems with unexpected current flow and higher standby power, which is important, for precision designs or low-power designs.

3) Thermal Runaway Risk

When there is leakage the device loses more power. This makes the device get really hot. The heat then causes more leakage. The leakage and heat keep going forth like this. This can cause problems, for the device like getting too hot and eventually failing if we do not do something to stop it.

4) Reliability and Performance

Temperature effects must be considered in design to ensure the diode behaves predictably across the expected ambient and junction temperature range.
